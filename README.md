# Mindful

## Intro ##
Mindful is a **minimalistic journaling web app** without the flairs and distractions of social media. Create an account and start writing down your everyday thoughts on this minimalistic platform.

## Instructions ##
To start your account, simply provide your email, a password, and a username. Click the sign up button and you'll be brought into the homepage. In the homepage, you can add new journal entries, scroll through your past journals, filter them, edit them, and delete them as well. A journal entry consists of a title, a date, an emotion, and the body. You can filter your journals based on date (i.e. year, month) and the emotion you assigned to each journal.
